Breathe Easy Sheffield works to make social spaces safer and more inclusive.

We promote measures that reduce the risk of airborne illness transmission at indoor events. Nobody should have to choose between socialising and their health.

## Making events safer for everyone

Simple, relatively low-cost safety measures can dramatically reduce the risk of catching Covid and other airborne illnesses (flu, RSV) at indoor events. Organisers and venues can clean indoor air without compromising the event experience through measures such as air purification and ventilation . 

Enhancing event safety in this way can increase access by people who are clinically vulnerable. Being able to gather without getting sick, temporarily or permanently, benefits everyone.

### Cleaner air in shared spaces

Breathe Easy offers [Covid safety guidance](<>) to organisers looking to make their events more accessible and [lends free air purifiers](<>) and [](<>)clean air equipment.

In its first year in 2025, the Breathe Easy Sheffield clean air guidance and lending service supported 50 events across Sheffield and brought cleaner indoor air to at least 2,400 people.

### Community and connection

Breathe Easy Sheffield hosts monthly Covid-safer socials (see [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/breatheeasysheffield/) and [mailing list](https://gmail.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5befd4a851cd5a433e63b6f8a&id=d368619d99) for details), and weekly online calls.

In 2025, we made history by hosting the UK’s first Covid-safer gig. We run online film streams, games socials, and creative sessions, with regular hybrid and online events for people who want to take part from home.

We deliver talks and workshops as well as 1:1 advice sessions to groups across Sheffield who want to make their community gatherings safer and reduce the spread of infectious airborne illnesses.

## About us

Breathe Easy Sheffield was founded by Chloe and Jade, two Sheffield locals.

We take precautions against Covid to protect ourselves and our loved ones. In 2024, with people encouraged to “get over Covid”, we found ourselves isolated. We couldn’t safely attend indoor public venues to socialise or organise, and we knew we weren’t alone.

We created Breathe Easy Sheffield to reduce exclusion and improve access to indoor social and cultural events. We've since been joined by delightful fellow travellers, Breathe Easy London.
