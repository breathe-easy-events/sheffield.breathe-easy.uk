Breathe Easy Sheffield is a volunteer-led organisation working to make indoor social and cultural spaces safer, more inclusive, and more accessible.

We believe no one should have to choose between socialising and their health. By using and promoting Covid safety measures, we support people to gather, organise, and create together with reduced risk.

## Who we are

We are Chloe and Jade, two Sheffield locals who set up Breathe Easy Sheffield using our experience in community organising and events.

We both need to take precautions against Covid to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Four years into the pandemic, with people encouraged to “get over Covid” and abandon safety measures, we found ourselves increasingly isolated. We couldn’t safely attend indoor public venues to socialise or organise, and we knew we weren’t alone.

Breathe Easy Sheffield was created to reduce exclusion and improve access to indoor social and cultural events.

Simple, relatively low-cost safety measures can dramatically reduce the risk of catching Covid and other airborne illnesses at indoor events. Being able to gather without getting sick, temporarily or permanently, benefits everyone. We believe safer spaces should be the norm, not the exception.

## What we do

We offer [Covid safety guidance](https://sheffield.breathe-easy.uk/how-to-guide-for-covid-safer-events/) to organisers looking to make their events more accessible, and support this with a free [lending library](https://sheffield.breathe-easy.uk/lending-library/) of clean air equipment.

We host monthly Covid-safer meet-ups at Gut Level Sheffield for socialising and organising, and also run occasional ad hoc events.

Why should anyone have to choose between socialising and safety? We already have the knowledge and the technology to make indoor events safer for everyone.

### Cleaner air in shared spaces

Our lending library supports community groups, organisers, and venues to make practical improvements to indoor air quality, reducing the risk of infection transmission and increasing accessibility.

In 2025 we reached an important milestone with the launch of our air purifier lending library.

To date we have supported 50 events across Sheffield, helping bring cleaner air into shared spaces. Altogether, we estimate that over 2,400 people have benefited from cleaner air through this work so far.

### Community, events, and connection

Throughout 2025 we hosted monthly in-person socials and weekly online calls, offering opportunities to connect, create, play, and simply be together in Covid-conscious ways.

We also made history by hosting the UK’s first Covid-safer gig with a livestream option, alongside online film streams, games socials, and creative sessions. These hybrid and online events made it possible for people to take part from home as well as in person.

### Advocacy and wider impact

Alongside events, we focus on advocacy and sharing knowledge.

In 2025 we published our how-to guide for Covid-safer events, took part in research, signed the Global Pledge for Healthy Indoor Air, and joined memorial and awareness-raising work around Long Covid. We ran a webinar with The Sheffield ME Group on Covid safety and connected with other Covid-conscious groups.

2025 also saw the launch of [Breathe Easy London](https://london.breathe-easy.uk/), and we’re delighted to welcome them into the Breathe Easy family.
