## 2. Introduction

Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility. The safeguarding leads are responsible for addressing any safeguarding concerns, but looking after the safety of the team and those we interact with is up to all of us.

Breathe Easy Sheffield recognises the harm that individual actions and societal structures can pose to everyone, including those who are disabled and/or at higher risk from Covid infections and other similar transmissible illnesses.

We are aware that our attendees at our events include disabled and clinically vulnerable people. Not everyone who is disabled is at risk of harm’, however, disability can increase vulnerability to abuse.

This policy will explain how Breathe Easy Sheffield aims to create environments which prevent safeguarding issues from arising, and how we respond to incidents if they occur. This policy applies to everyone we work with or who operates on our behalf, including: children, adults, committee members and volunteers. We acknowledge our duty to act appropriately in response to any allegations, reports or suspicions of abuse.

This policy has been drawn up in order to enable Breathe Easy Sheffield to:

- promote good practice and operate in a way that prevents harm, abuse and coercion; 
- ensure that any allegations or suspicions of abuse are dealt with appropriately and that the person experiencing abuse is supported; and
- stop that abuse occurring.

This policy does not exist in isolation, and sits alongside our other policies. Even where this policy is most applicable, there might still be crossover with other policies.

This policy document may not cover every eventuality or set of circumstances, and so Breathe Easy Sheffield will take care to consider on a case-by-case basis when a safeguarding case arises - prioritising the wants and needs of the person being harmed, or at risk of being harmed.

### What is abuse?

Some types of harm are clearly described in UK legislation including physical abuse, emotional abuse, economic abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. We expand this definition to include cultural and structural harm which can show up in institutions we may partner with (e.g. funding bodies, and charities) and in the lack of Covid safety in almost all areas of society.

## 3. Laying the Groundwork (Prevention of Safeguarding Issues)

Our aim is to create a community where everyone is respected and where all contributions are valued. In seeking to build connections and relationships with people who attend our events, and being clear about expectations (both in terms of Covid safety, and conduct at our events) we hope to reduce potential harm.

### Partner Organisations

Sometimes, when operating alongside other organisations, we may not be able to override the decision of a partner in how they deal with potential safeguarding situations. One of the ways we can avoid this is by sharing our Safeguarding Policy and Procedure with partners and asking that they read it and share their own policies with us before agreeing to the activity, preferably in writing. This way we hope to both advocate for a more care-led approach and foster a collaborative relationship so that we can jointly address challenging situations.

## 4. Procedures (Responding to Safeguarding Issues)

### Emergency

If the danger is immediate, this is an emergency situation. We acknowledge the potential harm that may be caused by involving emergency services, such as police and ambulance workers, when engaging with marginalised and minoritised communities, including the risk of Covid infection. We will avoid this involvement unless absolutely necessary. However, in an emergency, where the safeguarding risk and danger is immediate, the priorities will be:

- to keep yourself, volunteers and community members physically safe;
- to consider whether it is necessary to call the emergency services, and make this call if so;
- to request that any attending emergency services take precautions to prevent the spread of Covid, such as wearing masks;
- to provide basic first aid if appropriate / request the attention of the First Aider;
- to ask the person who was harmed/at risk of harm what they would like to happen, while not making promises you may be unable to keep;
- to preserve any evidence.
- to inform the person concerned of what will happen next and why, including who will be informed of the incident. If you are unsure, inform the person that you will need to speak with the DSL and/or DDSL and will keep them updated.
- to inform the DSL or DDSL if they are not present.
- to download the read-only [Safeguarding Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1T41MKQf0oSWhcK8ibCV3espmuxrvLPo5KyJ3j818SLk/edit), complete it as soon as possible using factual, unbiased language and send it securely to the DSL or DDSL. If the form is temporarily saved on a personal computer, it must only be stored for as long as necessary to submit it and must be deleted immediately afterwards. 


### Non-Emergency

If the danger is not immediate, this is a non-emergency situation.
If an allegation is disclosed to you or you witness an incident the priorities will be:

- to keep everyone involved safe, which may involve moving to another location;
- to reassure the person concerned and listen to what they are saying;
- to remain calm and do not show shock or disbelief;
- to tell the person that the information will be treated seriously;
- to ask the person what they would like to happen, but do not make promises you may be unable to keep;
- to inform the person of what will happen next and why, including who will be informed of the incident. If you are unsure, inform the person that you will need to speak with the DSL and/or DDSL and will keep them updated;
- *do not* start to investigate or ask detailed or probing questions - only ask questions to clarify if something is unclear.
- *do not* promise to keep it a secret.
- to download the read-only [Safeguarding Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1T41MKQf0oSWhcK8ibCV3espmuxrvLPo5KyJ3j818SLk/edit), complete it as soon as possible using factual, unbiased language and send it securely to the DSL or DDSL. If the form is temporarily saved on a personal computer, it must only be stored for as long as necessary to submit it and must be deleted immediately afterwards

All incidents or alleged incidents will be discussed with the DSL/DDSL. If you feel unable to raise it with the DSL/DDSL, you can directly contact the [Sheffield Adult Safeguarding Partnership](https://www.sheffieldasp.org.uk/sasp) or the [Sheffield Safeguarding Hub (children and young people)](https://www.safeguardingsheffieldchildren.org/p/processes/referring-a-safeguarding-concern-to-childrens-social-care), though this may lead to an institutional response to the situation, which could cause more harm than good. The full scope of the best interests of the person concerned should always be taken into account before decisions are made.

In order to implement this Policy, Breathe Easy Sheffield will seek:

- to promote the freedom, agency, dignity and privacy of the person who has experienced or is experiencing abuse;
- to promote the rights of all people to live free from abuse and coercion;
- to manage activities in a way which promotes safety and prevents abuse;
- to recruit any volunteers safely, ensuring all necessary checks are made; and
- to provide effective management for any volunteers through supervision and support.

### Sharing Information

We acknowledge that we must always balance the potential harm involved in reporting incidents with the harm caused by the incident itself, and will always take the lead of the person at risk of harm when possible.
If we feel that someone would benefit from external support we will gain permission from people before sharing information about them with another agency wherever possible.  A referral to an external agency on behalf of an adult shall only be made with the person at risk of harm’s consent unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:

- we reasonably believe that the adult at risk of harm lacks the capacity to consent to a referral;
- there is reason to believe that the adult at risk of harm may be under coercion not to consent and there is a public protection risk (e.g. human trafficking, modern slavery); or
- there is a serious risk of harm to life.

Capacity is a [complex subject](https://www.nhs.uk/social-care-and-support/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/) which is time- and decision- specific. No-one at Breathe Easy Sheffield will be expected to complete a capacity assessment.

Children are less able than adults to protect themselves and generally rely on adults to meet their basic needs. If anyone at Breathe Easy Sheffield becomes aware that there is or may be a child at risk of [abuse or neglect](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/child-abuse-and-neglect/recognising-and-responding-to-abuse#:~:text=Contact%20the%20NSPCC%20Helpline%20on,referral%20to%20the%20local%20authority.) a referral may be made to Children's Social Care. We will endeavour to discuss any referrals with the parent or guardian of that child if we do not believe that doing so will increase the likelihood or intensity of that harm. We may still make a referral to Children’s Social Care without the explicit consent of the parent or guardian if we are worried that the child may require services to keep them safe.

We will not ask volunteers to make decisions around consent and referrals to external agencies, and any referral will be made by the DSL or DDSL if required. If we need to make a referral we will be explicit about the need for anyone intervening to take precautions to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid-19 during any face-to-face meetings (for example, wearing masks), and we will offer guidance and explanations to support professionals and community members.

## 5. Managing Allegations Made Against a Volunteer

Breathe Easy Sheffield will ensure that any allegations made against committee members or volunteers will be dealt with swiftly, thoroughly and with care.

The same process as detailed above (section 4) will be followed. As volunteers are tasked with upholding this policy, any allegation against them will be treated robustly as the serious situation it is.

The safety of the individual(s) concerned is paramount. A risk assessment must be undertaken as soon as possible, ideally within 7 days, to assess the level of risk posed by the alleged perpetrator. This will include whether it is safe for them to continue in their role or any other role within the organisation whilst the investigation is undertaken.

The DSL (and DDSL, if necessary) will assess the best course of action and ensure that Breathe Easy Sheffield's procedures are coordinated with any other enquiries taking place as part of the ongoing management of the allegation.

## 6. Recording and Managing Confidential Information

Breathe Easy Sheffield is committed to maintaining confidentiality wherever possible and information around Safeguarding issues should be shared only with those who need to know.

All allegations/concerns should be recorded on a Safeguarding Reporting Form, kept in Breathe Easy Sheffield's Google Drive storage. The information should be factual and not based on opinions. Record what the person tells you, what you have seen, and any witnesses if appropriate. Recording what the individual has told you verbatim is often appropriate.

The information that is recorded will be kept secure and will comply with data protection laws. Access to this information will be restricted to the DSL and DDSL. It may be passed to partner agencies if this is necessary to keep someone safe. As above (Section 4) we will aim to gain the consent of the person involved before sharing any information.

## 7. Designated Safeguarding Lead Roles and Responsibilities

- to ensure that all volunteers and committee members are aware of what they should do and who they should go to if they have concerns that someone may be experiencing, or has experienced, abuse or neglect.
- to ensure that concerns are acted on, clearly recorded on a Safeguarding Reporting Form and that appropriate referrals are made if necessary.
- to follow up any referrals and ensure the issues have been addressed.
- to reinforce the need for confidentiality and ensure that board members and volunteers adhere to good practice with regard to confidentiality and security. The period when a person starts to challenge abuse is often when the risk of increased harm is greatest.
- to ensure that volunteers engaging directly with people who have experienced abuse, or who are experiencing abuse, are well supported and receive appropriate supervision.

## 8. Disseminating and Reviewing

This Safeguarding Policy and Procedures document will be clearly communicated to committee members, volunteers and partner organisations. The DSL will be responsible for ensuring that this is done.

The Safeguarding Policy and Procedures will be reviewed annually by the Committee. The DSL and DDSL will be involved in this process and can recommend any changes. They will also ensure that any changes are clearly communicated to board members and any volunteers.
