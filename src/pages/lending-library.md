Create safer, more accessible and welcoming spaces by bringing clean air to your next event. 

The Breathe Easy clean air lending library offers access to air purifiers and CO2 monitoring for free to folks in Sheffield and surrounding areas.

### Clean the air with purifiers

Air purifiers use air filters to remove particles such as allergens, exhaust fumes and viruses from the air. Studies show air purification reduces risk of infection from airborne diseases such as Covid-19. Our high-efficiency portable air cleaners from Smart Air UK are portable and easy to use.

### Better ventilation with CO2 monitors

Ventilation means providing fresh air and removing polluted, stale air. It helps to dilute and remove aerosols that carry viruses like Covid-19 and flu through the air. CO2 monitors are compact devices that tell you how ventilated your event space is. Our compact CO2 monitor is a simple device to track your ventilation in real time.
