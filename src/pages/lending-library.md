### Our Lending Library
Creating safe, accessible and welcoming spaces is more important than ever. Good ventilation and clean air are essential for protecting our communities, especially when gathering indoors. To make it easier for local event organisers to host healthier, Covid-safer events, we’ve set up a Lending Library of Clean Air Equipment.

Our library currently offers:

2 [cCc] (update to say 4) SA600 Air Purifiers - High-efficiency portable air cleaners designed to filter out airborne particles, including viruses, allergens, and pollutants. Each purifier is simple to set up and run.

1 CO₂ Monitor - A compact device that helps you track ventilation levels in real time. 

By borrowing this equipment, you can help protect everyone at your events. 

### How to Borrow Equipment

Borrowing from the Lending Library is simple. Equipment is free to use, though we encourage you to handle it with care so others can benefit as well.
