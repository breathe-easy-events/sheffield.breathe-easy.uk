Create safer, more accessible spaces by bringing clean air to your next event. 

The Breathe Easy Sheffield lending library offers portable clean air equipment **for free**.

### Clean the air with purifiers üå¨Ô∏è

Air purifiers use filters to remove particles such as allergens, exhaust fumes and viruses from the air. Studies show air purification reduces risk of infection from airborne diseases such as Covid-19. Our high-efficiency portable air cleaners from [Smart Air UK](https://smartairfilters.com/uk/) are easy to use.

### Ventilate better with CO2 monitoring üçÉ

Ventilation means providing fresh air and removing polluted, stale air. It helps to dilute and remove aerosols that carry viruses like Covid-19 and flu through the air. CO2 monitors are compact devices that tell you how ventilated your event space is so you know if you need to take action, for example by opening windows to the outside. Our compact CO2 monitor is portable and easy to use.
