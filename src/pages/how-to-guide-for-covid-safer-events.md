A guide for anyone who organises events indoors and wants to keep attendees safe(r) from the life-altering impacts of Covid-19 and other airborne diseases.

## ðŸ”¬ Choosing your safety measures


Thank-you for thinking about ways to make people safer at your event.Â 

There are seven Covid safety measures in this guide. Many are cheap or free, although some require upfront investment and some take more time.

The measures are in order of relative effectiveness, but all can be effective. No single measure is perfect, so a combination is ideal (the [â€˜Swiss Cheeseâ€™ Model](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-40ac92b1-1750-4e86-9936-2cda6b0acb3f)).

**But itâ€™s better to use *any* safety measures than none at all.**

We offer two options for implementing each safety measure:Â 
- robust (heart ðŸ’š): recommended safest action.
- minimum (circle ðŸŸ ): less safe, but better than nothing.

Measures should apply to *everyone*: staff, volunteers, organisers, and attendees.
