A guide for anyone who organises events indoors and wants to keep attendees safe(r) from the life-altering impacts of Covid-19 and other airborne diseases.

## 🔬 Choosing your safety measures


Thank-you for thinking about ways to make people safer at your event. 

There are seven Covid safety measures in this guide. Many are cheap or free, although some require upfront investment and some take more time.

The measures are in order of relative effectiveness, but all can be effective. No single measure is perfect, so a combination is ideal (the [‘Swiss Cheese’ Model](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-40ac92b1-1750-4e86-9936-2cda6b0acb3f)).

**But it’s better to use *any* safety measures than none at all.**

We offer two options for implementing each safety measure: 
- robust (heart 💚): recommended safest action.
- minimum (circle 🟠): less safe, but better than nothing.

Measures should apply to *everyone*: staff, volunteers, organisers, and attendees.

## 🔊 Talking about Covid

 🛎️ Communicate your Covid safety measures in advance to everyone who will be in your event space, so they know what to do and expect. 
These days Covid is mostly talked about in the past tense. Covid-19 safety measures are no longer common, so you need to explain why you are putting them back in place to avoid confusion.

You may be asking people to change their ‘normal’ behaviour. Others may assume that your safety information is a mistake, left over from the early days of the pandemic. 

Being upfront and clear about what you are doing and why (i.e. to keep everyone safer, especially people who are at higher risk) is a vital part of making your Covid safety measures effective.

Ask people at your event how your Covid measures impacted them. Seek feedback in particular from the disabled and Covid-conscious communities.

### 1. Sickness policy 🦠

An event sickness policy encourages people with symptoms of illness (e.g. coughing, sneezing, vomiting, fever) to stay away. This helps to remove the risk (infectious people) altogether. 

💚 Robust: People are asked not to come if they are unwell. Refunds are available on request. Visibly unwell attendees are asked to leave.

🟠 Minimum: People are asked not to come if they are unwell.

💔 Absent: No messaging about illness.

### 2. Remote access 🤖

Offering options for people to join your event remotely means that if someone is unwell, they are more likely to attend online rather than showing up in person. This helps remove the risk (infectious people) altogether. An additional benefit is improving inclusion for people who cannot attend in-person events.

💚 Robust: Attendees can join the event remotely (eg online) in a meaningful and active way.

🟠 Minimum: Remote (online) participants can observe, but not actively participate.

💔 Absent: No remote (online) joining options.

### 3. Testing 🔎

Testing requirements encourage people who are testing positive with Covid-19 to stay away. This helps to remove the risk (infectious people) altogether. Rapid Antigen Tests (also known as Lateral Flow Tests or LFTs) for Covid-19 are not perfect but rarely return false positives; if someone tests positive, they almost certainly have Covid-19. 

💚 Robust: People coming to the event are required to test for Covid on the day. Test status is asked about on entry and tests are available if people forget or can’t afford them.

🟠 Minimum: People coming to the event are requested to take a Covid test before arrival.

💔 Absent: No test requests or requirements.

### 4. Ventilation 🍃

Ventilation means providing fresh air and removing polluted, stale air. It helps to dilute and remove aerosols that carry viruses like Covid-19 and flu through the air, which float and move like smoke. Someone who has Covid-19 will be breathing it into your event space. Without ventilation, the volume of infectious aerosols in the shared air at your event will increase throughout.

💚 Robust: Multiple windows and/or doors fully opened to the outside throughout the event space, and/or the venue has a fresh air ventilation system that is on throughout.

🟠 Minimum: One window/door to the outside is opened at regular intervals.

💔 Absent: The event has no fresh air ventilation.

### 5. Air purification 🌬️

Air purification uses air filters to remove particles such as allergens, exhaust fumes and viruses from the air. While purification doesn’t stop all infections, particularly those passed on at close-range, studies show it reduces risk of infection from airborne diseases such as Covid-19. HEPA-grade purifiers filter 99% of infectious particles. 

💚 Robust: Air purifier(s) are on during the event and are sufficient for the event size.

🟠 Minimum: At least one air purifier is on during the event.

💔 Absent: No air purification.

### 6. CO2 monitoring 📈

CO2 monitors tell you how ventilated your event space is. Humans breathe out carbon dioxide (CO2), so the level of CO2 in a space tells you how much of the air has been breathed out by other people and is a useful proxy measure for the risk of infection with airborne illnesses. As a general rule, a higher level of CO2 means a higher risk. When you let in fresh air to your event space, CO2 levels and infection risk will reduce.

💚 Robust: There is a CO2 monitor in a central location and event organisers take action to improve ventilation if CO2 levels go too high.

🟠 Minimum: There is a CO2 monitor in place for information only.

💔 Absent: No CO2 monitoring.

### 7. Wearing masks 😷

Masks are highly effective at filtering out viruses if they are well-fitting and good quality. When in close contact with someone with an airborne illness (e.g. sitting next to them inside for an hour), a mask is the most reliable tool we have to prevent infections. Masks can prevent you from both catching or spreading illness.

Masks have sadly become stigmatised and politicised, which can make people who wear them feel isolated or/and physically unsafe at events. Including masking in your event’s accessibility measures counters this feeling and promotes inclusion.

💚 Robust: Masks are required and provided.

🟠 Minimum: Masks are encouraged or welcomed, but not mandatory.

💔 Absent: No masking information or provision.
