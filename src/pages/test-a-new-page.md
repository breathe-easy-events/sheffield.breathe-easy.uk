Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility. The safeguarding leads are responsible for addressing any safeguarding concerns, but looking after the safety of the team and those we interact with is up to all of us.



Breathe Easy Sheffield recognises the harm that individual actions and societal structures can pose to everyone, including those who are disabled and/or at higher risk from covid infections and other similar transmissible illnesses.



We are aware that our attendees at our events include disabled and clinically vulnerable people. Not everyone who is disabled is an ‘adult at risk of harm’, however, disability can increase vulnerability to abuse.



This policy will explain how Breathe Easy Sheffield aims to create environments which prevent safeguarding issues from arising, and how we respond to incidents if they occur. This policy applies to everyone we work with or who operates on our behalf, including: children, adults, committee members and volunteers. We acknowledge our duty to act appropriately in response to any allegations, reports or suspicions of abuse.
