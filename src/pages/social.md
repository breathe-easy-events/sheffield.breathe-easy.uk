Join us for a Covid-safer screening of Cluedo inspired slapstick comedy, Clue (1985).

It’s not just a game anymore! Six dinner guests invited to a mysterious mansion one dark and stormy night find their host, Mr Boddy, dead. The witty butler (Tim Curry) must uncover the culprit before they are all taken down one by one. Cult classic, Clue, is a fast-talking, dry-humoured, black comedy featuring your favourite suspects from Miss Scarlett to Professor Plum.

This screening has been kindly produced by Breathe Easy supporter and attendee Kit, who will act as projectionist on the evening. It was made possible by Cinema For All’s Launch programme with the support of the BFI, awarding funds from the National Lottery.

Masks required indoors. 

### Event Details

As usual, our Covid-safer social will be hosted at Sheffield’s fantastic DIY community event space and collective, [Gut Level](https://gutlevel.co.uk/) (18+ age restriction). We have exclusive use of the space. A very good value (cashless) bar is **currently offering non-alcoholic drinks only** including pop, mocktails, hot tea and coffee. If you want to drink alcohol you can BYOB. There is also a luxurious separate rest space that has a room-sized king+ bed (up a flight of stairs).

The film is 94 minutes, rated PG and will be shown with captions. There will be an interval and time to socialise before and after the screening. 

The screening will begin at 6.30pm.

::: [show] FAQ

**Who are you?**

Breathe Easy is brought to you by Chloe and Jade, two Covid/infection-conscious Sheffield locals with backgrounds in organising, activism and cultural events. We have no funding for Breathe Easy Sheffield and are arranging our events on a voluntary and not-for-profit basis.

**Can I follow you online?**

Yes! Check this website for updates or follow us [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/breatheeasysheffield/) or keep up to date with our events series is via our [email list](https://gmail.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5befd4a851cd5a433e63b6f8a&id=d368619d99).

**Why do you still care about Covid?**

In 2026, the Covid-19 virus is still circulating in society. Going to an in-person event today brings with it significantly more risks than in 2019. The risks of Covid and other airborne infectious disease (such as flu and respiratory viruses) can prevent access to events by people with disabilities, chronic illness, caregivers, people who are immunocompromised, and those who live with them. These risks are also higher for communities who are marginalised in society.

Breathe Easy Sheffield aims to improve access to social and cultural events by putting enhanced safety measures in place that reduce transmission risk.

**Why haven't you included more safety measures at your event?**

Safety from airborne infectious disease at a public event is on a spectrum of more to less safe. Everyone has different needs to feel safe _enough_. Breathe Easy wants to explore a range of different ways to make events safer and reduce transmission risk that other venues and organisers can replicate. This means we will decide on different measures for each event and some events will include more or less safety measures. Our decisions are based on our understanding of a measure’s risk impact, what we can afford and manage, and replicability to other venues.

**Can you guarantee that I won’t catch Covid or another illness at your event?**

No. We will use measures evidenced to reduce the transmission of airborne infections, but we cannot eliminate risk. We will communicate the measures we have taken so you can make an informed decision but neither we nor the venue can take responsibility if you catch an illness at our event.

**How will you enforce your safety measures?**

We don’t want to use security at our events. We have limited enforcement mechanisms other than clarity and peer pressure. We ask attendees to confirm they will follow our requirements in advance. If someone violates a required precaution, we will give a chance to correct and then ask them to leave.

**Why haven't you met my access needs?**

It can be hurtful or frustrating when an “accessible” event is inaccessible to you so we are sorry if we have not met your needs. We are a tiny team doing something voluntarily, and have limited capacity, but we will always consider advance reasonable accommodation requests.
