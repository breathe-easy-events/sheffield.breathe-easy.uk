## March: Film Screening and Social

**Monday 16th March 6-9pm**

Join us for a Covid-safer screening of Cluedo inspired slapstick comedy, Clue (1985).

It’s not just a game anymore! Six dinner guests invited to a mysterious mansion one dark and stormy night find their host, Mr Boddy, dead. The witty butler (Tim Curry) must uncover the culprit before they are all taken down one by one. Cult classic, Clue, is a fast-talking, dry-humoured, black comedy featuring your favourite suspects from Miss Scarlett to Professor Plum.

The film is 94 minutes, rated PG and will be shown with captions. There will be an interval and time to socialise before and after the screening.

Mask and negative Covid test required.

This screening has been kindly produced by Breathe Easy supporter and attendee Kit, who will act as projectionist on the evening. It was made possible by Cinema For All’s Launch programme with the support of the BFI, awarding funds from the National Lottery.
