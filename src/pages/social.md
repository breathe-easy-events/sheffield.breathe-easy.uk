## March: Film Screening and Social

**Monday 16th March 6-9pm**

Join us for a Covid-safer screening of Cluedo inspired slapstick comedy, Clue (1985).

It’s not just a game anymore! Six dinner guests invited to a mysterious mansion one dark and stormy night find their host, Mr Boddy, dead. The witty butler (Tim Curry) must uncover the culprit before they are all taken down one by one. Cult classic, Clue, is a fast-talking, dry-humoured, black comedy featuring your favourite suspects from Miss Scarlett to Professor Plum.

This screening has been kindly produced by Breathe Easy supporter and attendee Kit, who will act as projectionist on the evening. It was made possible by Cinema For All’s Launch programme with the support of the BFI, awarding funds from the National Lottery.


Masks required indoors. 

### Event Details

As usual, our Covid-safer social will be hosted at Sheffield’s fantastic DIY community event space and collective, [Gut Level](https://gutlevel.co.uk/) (18+ age restriction). We have exclusive use of the space. A very good value (cashless) bar is **currently offering non-alcoholic drinks only** including pop, mocktails, hot tea and coffee. If you want to drink alcohol you can BYOB. There is also a luxurious separate rest space that has a room-sized king+ bed (up a flight of stairs).


The film is 94 minutes, rated PG and will be shown with captions. There will be an interval and time to socialise before and after the screening. 

The screening will begin at 6.30pm.
